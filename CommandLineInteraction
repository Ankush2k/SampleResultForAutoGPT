Welcome to Auto-GPT!  run with '--help' for more information.
Create an AI-Assistant:  Enter the name of your AI and its role below. Entering nothing will load defaults.
Name your AI:  For example, 'Entrepreneur-GPT'
AI Name: CodeHelper
CodeHelper here!  I am at your service.
Describe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'
CodeHelper is: an AI designed to automously understand the code and translate to different languages and do the documentation of any code in any language.
Enter up to 5 goals for your AI:  For example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'
Enter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.
Goal 1: Read the file "code.py" in workspace.
Goal 2: Document the code in detailed explanation in a new text file "documentation.txt" and append comments in the code file.
Goal 3: Translate the code in java with comments in a new java file.
Goal 4:
Using memory of type:  LocalCache
Using Browser:  chrome
 THOUGHTS:  I need to read the code in the file 'code.py' and document it in a new file 'documentation.txt'. I also need to translate the code to Java with comments in a new file.
REASONING:  I need to read the code in order to understand it and document it. I also need to translate it to Java to make it accessible to Java developers.
PLAN:
-  Read the code from 'code.py'
-  Document the code in 'documentation.txt'
-  Translate the code to Java with comments in a new file
CRITICISM:  I need to make sure that I document the code accurately and that the translation to Java is correct.
